                I’ve recently been hired as a part of the College of Visualization MentorCorp program. 
                This program is designed to teach low income students STEM concepts through projects during science class. 
                As a student mentor, I assist teachers who don’t know the STEM concepts in projects related to Circuits, 3D printing and other maker topics. <br><br>

                I also volunteer each year at my local church <a href="https://cgsccdogh.org/">Christ the Good Shepherd</a>'s Fall Festival.
