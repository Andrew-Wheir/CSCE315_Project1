                I’ve been studying Computer Science for about 6 years now. I’m most familiar with C++ and Java, though Python is my go too for quick projects. 
                I am also familiar with Haskell, x86 Assembly, C, along with the HTML, CSS and Javascript used to build this website. The areas of coding I want 
                to learn more about are Data Analytics and Visualization.<br><br>

                Outside of programming, I have lots of experience with the modeling softwares 
                <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/inventor/overview?">Autodesk Inventor</a> and AutoCAD. As a part of my job at the 
                <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/academics/fedc/index.html"> Fisher Engineering Design Center</a>, 
                I have lots of experience with 3D Printing, Laser Cutting, and PCB Manufacturing, along with general maker skills like soldering and circuit design. 
                I’m also proficient in basic photo editing using paint.net.<br><br>
