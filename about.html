                Howdy! My name is Andrew Wheir, and I hail from Tomball, a town in North-East Houston. I graduated from Tomball Memorial Highschool in 2020, 
                and (despite the pandemic), made it to A&M, where I’ve been studying Computer Science (with an emphasis on 
                <a href="https://pvfa.tamu.edu/academics/disciplines/visualization/">Visualization</a> for the past two years. 
                I have a keen interest in 3D Printing, for reasons that will be clear by the end of this page. I am still well on my way to becoming Neo, 
                but everyday I work toward that goal and it's never stopped being so engaging. Programming, for me, is such an engaging problem solving task, one that I just can’t 
                escape not thinking about. I think Texas A&M’s own <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/profiles/dshell.html">Dr. Shell</a> put it best: </br></br>

                “The power that we have today seems like fiction from the point of view of 1900’s smartest man. This unbridled power we have created for ourselves is truly like Prometheus
                stealing fire from the gods. We have the ability [to] harness such an amazing thing. And every day I do my job, I get to control that power.”</br></br>
                
                Outside of my academics, I have a job at the Fisher Engineering Design Center. The FEDC is a maker space for A&M Engineering students to help them learn, design and 
                build projects for their classes. My main role as a Student Technician is processing student requests for 3D Printing, Laser Cutting and PCB Milling. 
                This involves knowing how to properly run the machines, troubleshooting them if they don’t work properly, and doing basic repairs. </br></br>
                
                In my free time, my favorite hobby is 3D Modeling in Autodesk Inventor. I mostly just do props from video games and TV shows. You can find some of my work in the Projects section.</a> 
                I also play a lot of video games, and occasionally do some <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/user/Wheirdo"> speedrunning</a>. After long days of sitting and hitting buttons on a keyboard, I like to ride my bike, 
                skate around campus, and do ninja-gymnastics at <a href="https://powersportskids.com/ninja-warrior/">Powersports.
