                Computer Controller Program - A java program that automatically opens up Zoom calls 10 minutes before they start. I made this during 
                my freshman year (and the pandemic), as I would be working on a project on my laptop, and forget that class was starting. I used OOP 
                to make custom classes, scanner for file I/O and reading a CSV file containing my schedule, and Java's Robot class to type the URL's. Also,

                GPA Calculator - A python script that takes in your class schedule and grades, and outputs our GPA. I made this program so
                I could very easily see how well I needed to do on some classes to get into the Computer Science program. Whether I am currently
                in the Computer Science department because I knew what grades I needed to get or because I learned more about coding while making
                this program is up for you to decide.<br><br>

                In my free time, I also do alot of 3D Modeling in Autodesk Inventor. Here is the coolest thing I've made recently, a <a href="https://www.3dbenchy.com/">3D Benchy</a>
                made completly out of flat pieces, that I plan on laser cutting sometime soon:<br>
